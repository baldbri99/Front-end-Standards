# Vendor Styles

All vendors will be downloaded and imported into this library folder. Every vendor
will have a vendor specific folder with all of the contents inside. Folder structure
would look similar to:

```
📂- vendors
   📂- susy
   |  📁- language
   |  📁- output
   |  📁- su
   |  |- _su.scss
   📂- fontawesome
   |  |- _animated.scss
   |  |- _path.scss
   |  |- _font-awesome.scss
```
